# ChatGPT Token Cost Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing the costs associated with tokens generated from ChatGPT export chats. The script extracts messages from a JSON file, calculates the number of tokens used, and determines the costs for input and output tokens. Additionally, it groups the costs by month and saves the results in a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python modules: `json`, `pandas`, `datetime`, `tiktoken`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/levysoft/chatgpt-token-cost-analysis.git
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas tiktoken
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your `conversations.json` file in the main directory of the project.
2. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python chatgpt_analyze_token_costs.py
    ```

## Script Description

### Global Variables

- `cost_per_million_input_tokens`: Cost per million input tokens (5.00 USD)
- `cost_per_million_output_tokens`: Cost per million output tokens (15.00 USD)

### JSON File Loading

The script loads the `conversations.json` file and handles any exceptions during loading.

### Message Extraction

The `extract_messages(data)` function extracts messages from the nested JSON data and converts them into a pandas DataFrame.

### Token Calculation

The `calculate_tokens(text)` function uses the `cl100k_base` encoding to calculate the number of tokens in each message.

### Cost Calculation

The script separates input and output tokens and calculates the associated costs.

The total chat costs are calculated using OpenAI API pricing for GPT-4 (https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

The costs are calculated separately for input tokens (user) and output tokens (assistant), using specific pricing for GPT-4.

### Output

The results are grouped by month and saved to a CSV file `costs_per_month.csv`.

## Example Output

```bash
JSON file successfully loaded.
Number of messages extracted: 13694
Data converted to DataFrame.

## Web-Based Token Cost Analyzer

In addition to the Python script, I've created a single-page HTML + JavaScript application that allows anyone to analyze token costs locally. This HTML page does not use the `tiktoken` library, which is unavailable in JavaScript, but rather utilizes the `gpt-tokenizer` library.

### Why the HTML Page?

- **Accessibility**: This HTML page can be downloaded and run locally by anyone without needing to set up a Python environment.
- **Comprehensive Model Support**: Unlike the Python script, the HTML page includes support for multiple models with varying token costs, allowing for more flexible analysis.
- **Local Privacy**: The page ensures the privacy of your sensitive data because it works entirely locally. Your JSON file containing private chats is never uploaded to a remote server.

### Using the HTML Page

1. **Download the Page**: Click the download link on the page to save it for offline use.
2. **Select the Model**: Choose the appropriate model from the dropdown menu.
3. **Upload Your JSON File**: Select your `conversations.json` file to analyze.
4. **View Results**: The analysis results, including total and monthly costs, will be displayed directly on the page.

This web-based tool provides a more user-friendly and comprehensive way to analyze token costs for various models and use cases.

### Enhancing Privacy and Offline Functionality

To ensure the privacy of your data and provide functionality even when offline, the HTML page includes a mechanism to load the `GPTTokenizer_cl100k_base` encoder from a local source if the remote JavaScript file is not accessible. By default, the page attempts to load the tokenizer from the remote URL `https://unpkg.com/gpt-tokenizer`. If this remote file is not available, the script will then try to load a local version of the tokenizer (`cl100k_base.js`).

Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- The `checkGPTTokenizer` function first attempts to load the `GPTTokenizer_cl100k_base` encoder from the remote source.
- If the remote file is not accessible, it attempts to load the local `cl100k_base.js` file.
- If neither the remote nor local files are available, the script falls back to a rough approximation based on the number of words in the text. This fallback method, while not as precise, provides a useful estimate of token usage.

To use the local version of the tokenizer, make sure to download `cl100k_base.js` and place it in the same directory as the HTML file. This approach ensures that your data remains private and the functionality is available even without an internet connection.

This enhancement makes the tool more privacy-compliant and ensures that users can analyze their chat data under any network conditions.
